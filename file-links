# Linking of files

    If you need to maintain two (or more) copies of the same fi le on the system, instead of having separate physical copies, you can use one physical copy and multiple virtual copies, called links. 
    
    A link is a placeholder in a directory that points to the real location of the file. 
    
    Two types of fi le links are available in Linux:

        ■ A symbolic link
        ■ A hard link

# You can only create a hard link between files on the same physical medium. To create a link between fi les under separate physical mediums, you must use a symbolic link.

# Creating a hard link

    $ ln <existing-file-name> <new-file-name>
    
    $ ln file1 file2 # a hard link will be created by the name file2 for the file1. The inode of both files are equal.

# Creating a symbolic link

    $ ln -s <existing-file-name> <new-file-name>
    
    $ ln -s file1 file3 # a symbolic link will be created for the file1 named as file3. Their inode numbers are different. If original file is removed link will be broken.
