# Files & Directories

    Files contain data such as human-readable text, executable programs, or binary data that is used by the computer. 

    Directories are used to create organization within the filesystem. Directories can contain files and other directories.  

    File and directory names in Linux can contain lower case and upper case letters, numbers, spaces and special characters.  

    Filenames can contain a suffix which comes after the period (.). Unlike Windows, this suffix has no special meaning in Linux; it is there for human understanding.

# Getting the current location at the prompt;

    The command 'pwd' will print working directory

# The tilde (~) is a special character that represents the user’s home directory.
