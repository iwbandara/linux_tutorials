# Managing files and directories on Linux using command line tools

# A file is a collection of data with a name and set of attributes.

# A directory is a special kind of file used to organize files.

# The 'mkdir' command is used to create directories.

# The shell interprets the '~' character as your home directory.

# mkdir, by default, wonâ€™t create a directory inside of a directory that does not exist. The -p or --parents option instructs mkdir to create parent directories if they do not exist.

# The find program is usually used to search for files and directories, but without any options, it will show you a listing of all the files, directories, and sub-directories of your current directory.

# Files are moved and renamed with the 'mv' command.

# The cp command is used to copy files and directories.
