# Linux Variables

    Linux works with two variable types. They are LOCAL & ENVIRONMENT.

# Local Variables:
    
    name=Indika # this will create a variable named 'name' with a value of 'Indika'. Do not use spaces before & after the equal sign.

# Environemntal variables:

    They are all CAPITAL letters. Ex: PATH, USER, etc.

    echo $USER # prints out the username of the current user of the system.

# In order to remove a variable, you will need to use the command unset:

    name="Indika" # this sets the variable

    echo $name

    unset name # this remove the variable
    
# unset requires the name of the variable as an argument. Therefore you may not add $ to the name
