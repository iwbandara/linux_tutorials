# A shell is a program that accepts and interprets text-mode commands and provides an interface to the system.

# In Linux, bash is the most common default shell for user accounts.

# The time command times how long subsequent commands take to execute.

	For instance, typing time pwd tells you how long the system took to execute the pwd command.
