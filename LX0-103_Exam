# A shell is a program that accepts and interprets text-mode commands and provides an interface to the system.

# In Linux, bash is the most common default shell for user accounts.

# The time command times how long subsequent commands take to execute.

	For instance, typing time pwd tells you how long the system took to execute the pwd command.

# The exit and logout commands both terminate the shell. The exit command terminates any shell, but the logout command terminates only login shells.

# You can quickly determine if a command is a builtin command by using the type command.

# When external commands are installed, the internal command takes precedence.

# To delete an environment variable, use the unset command. The command takes the name of an environment variable (without the leading $ symbol) as an option.
	
	$ unset PS1

# Typically, the tee command is used in conjunction with data pipes so that a program's output can be both stored and viewed immediately.

	$ ls | tee result.txt # ls commands output will be displayed on the shell & the same will be copied to the result.txt file.
