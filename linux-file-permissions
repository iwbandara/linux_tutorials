# Linux file permissions

# The first field in the output listing is a code that describes the permissions for the files and
directories. 

# The first character in the field defines the type of the object:

	- for fi les
 
	d for directories
	
	l for links

	c for character devices
 
	b for block devices
	
	n for network devices

# Each set of three characters defines an access permission triplet:

	r for read permission for the object
	
	w for write permission for the object
	
	x for execute permission for the object

# The three sets relate the three levels of security for the object:
	
	The owner of the object
	
	The group that owns the object
	
	Everyone else on the system

# The umask command sets the default permissions for any fi le or directory you create in the system

# The umask command shows and sets the default permissions.

# The full permission for a fi le is mode 666 (read/write permission for all), but for a directory it’s 777 (read/write/execute permission for all).

# The umask value is normally set in the /etc/profile startup fi le in most Linux distribu-
tions

# The chmod command allows you to change the security settings for fi les and directories.

# The format of the chmod command is:

	chmod options mode file
	
	$ sudo chmod 755 file.txt # applies rwx to owner, r-x permissions to the group & others of the file.txt

# The first group of characters defines to whom the new permissions apply:

	u for the user

	g for the group

	o for others (everyone else)
	
	a for all of the above

# Note that the –F option for the ls command indicates whether a file has execution permissions by adding an asterisk to the filename.

# The -R parameter performs the fi le and directory changes recursively.
