# Getting Help in Linux

    Three methods can be used, '--help', man & info.

    '--help' parameter will give basically a brief set of instructions. Be aware that the instructions from --help often are rather brief compared to the other sources of documentation

# Man Pages => 
    
    Most commands provide a manual page or “man” page. 

    This documentation is usually installed with the software and can be accessed with the man command.

    $ man mkdir # this command will display the man page for the command 'mkdir'.

    You can use the up and down arrow keys or the space bar to navigate through the man page. To exit the man page, press Q.

    Internally, man uses the 'less' command to display the man page’s content. 'less' lets you search for text within a man page.
