# The root user account is the administrator for the Linux system and is always assigned
UID 0.

# A system account is a special account that services running on the system use to gain access to resources on the system.

# Now, most Linux systems hold user passwords in a separate fi le (called the shadow file,
located at /etc/shadow)

# The /etc/passwd fi le is a standard text fi le. You can use any text editor to manually perform user management functions (such as adding, modifying, or removing user accounts) directly in the /etc/passwd file.

# In Linux /etc/shadow file has control over the user account passwords. Only root user has access to this file.

# There are nine fi elds in each /etc/shadow fi le record:

	The login name corresponding to the login name in the /etc/passwd fi le
	
	The encrypted password

	The number of days since January 1, 1970, that the password was last changed

	The minimum number of days before the password can be changed

	The number of days before the password must be changed
	
	The number of days before password expiration that the user is warned to change the password

	The number of days after a password expires before the account will be disabled
	
	The date (stored as the number of days since January 1, 1970) since the user account was disabled
	
	A field reserved for future use

# The primary tool used to add new users to your Linux system is useradd.

	$ sudo useradd <username>
	
	$ sudo useradd -u <UID> -g <GID> -c comment <username>
	
# By default, the useradd command doesn’t create a HOME directory, but the –m command line option tells it to create the HOME directory.

# By default, the userdel command removes only the user information from the /etc/passwd file. It doesn’t remove any files the account owns on the system.

	$ sudo userdel <username>
	
# If you use the -r parameter, userdel removes the user’s HOME directory, along with the user’s mail directory.

	$ sudo userdel -r <username>
	
# The usermod command is the most robust of the user account modifi cation utilities. It provides options for changing most of the fi elds in the /etc/passwd file.	

# Parameters used with 'usermod' command

	-c changes the comment of the user account.
	
	-e changes the user account expiration date.
	
	-g changes the default login group.

	-l changes the login name of the user account.
	
	-L locks the account so the user can’t log in.

	-p changes the password for the account.
	
	-U unlocks the account so the user can log in.
