# To remove the content of a file without deleting the file; for that Linux operating system offers a command called “truncate”.

# Truncating a file is much quicker and simpler without modifying the permissions and ownership of the file.

# The truncated size depends on the original size of the file; the extra data will be lost if the file size is greater than the specified size.

# The “>” shell redirection operator is the most popular and simplest way to truncate files.

  $ >file.txt
  
  $ du -h file.txt
  
# Another way to truncate file is:

  $ cat /dev/null > test.sh

# Use the “-s” option to remove the content of the files. This is a preferable way to manually delete a file. 
# The truncate command effectively eliminates all the contents of a file. 
# It does not delete the file itelf, but leaves it as a zero-byte file on the disk.

  $ truncate -s 0 file.txt
  
  $ du -sh file.txt # display the file size after the truncate process.
